# mpi-spatialjoin CS 584
Data Intensive Computing presents many challenges with parallel computing including storage, managing, accessing, and processing vast amounts of data. In this [paper](project writeup.pdf), we discuss the effects of data locality on Data Intensive Computing by comparing an MPI implementation with a Map Reduce (Hadoop) implementation. We show that partitioning the data with a context-aware mapping provides significant performance improvement compared to a Map Reduce approach which have no data locality consider- ations in their reduce tasks.

See the [write-up](project writeup.pdf) for this project.
